get Defi data from Ethereum blockchain and APis using python
To fetch DeFi data from the Ethereum blockchain and APIs using a Python script, you will need to do the following:

Research the data sources that will be necessary to gather the required information. This may involve examining transaction data, accessing protocol APIs, or interacting with protocol smart contracts.

Write scripts in Python to fetch the data for the past 3 months. These scripts may need to interact with the relevant protocols and APIs, as well as process and organize the data.

Publish the data in an Excel spreadsheet or similar format. This may involve formatting the data in a specific way, adding any necessary calculations or formulas, and ensuring that the data is clearly organized and easy to understand.
To complete these tasks, you will need to have strong skills in Python and be familiar with the Ethereum blockchain and the DeFi protocols and APIs that you will be using. You may also need to utilize libraries such as Web3.py or PyEthereum to interact with the blockchain and retrieve data.
